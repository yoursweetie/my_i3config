# my_i3config
**includes ~/.config/i3/config & /etc/i3status.conf on Arch Linux.**
***~/.config/i3/config*** is the user's i3config file and ***/etc/i3status.conf*** is the i3bar config file
and in ~/.config/i3, I also have a net-speed.sh to show net-speed on the i3bar! Thanks to https://github.com/i3/i3status/tree/master/contrib.
